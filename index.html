     <h2>Educational Objectives</h2>

<p>I have a background in computer sciences and engineering. I realized during my time at university the importance of organizing large volume of data and the positive impact this can have to create data-driven solutions that can eventually help countries and communities to make meaningful changes within their societies.</br>


My immediate educational goal is to gain a superior skillset that will allow me to efficiently process algorithms to extract value from diverse data sets. I would like to become proficient in languages such as R, Python and SQL.</br>

 My long-range career objectives are to use to do further research in predictive modeling and the significant impact it can have in strengthening cyber security. In preparation for my career ahead I have independently done 4-week courses on ‘coursera.org' to educate my self on python and usable security.</br>

I have the ability to build this broad skillset to develop the technical and analytical
 knowledge required for this important role.
  I look forward to the opportunities and am excited
   for the future.</p>
